# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes COVID-19 data from the years 2020 to 2023, focusing on various aspects such as total cases, deaths, population percentages, vaccination rates, and more. The goal is to gain insights into the impact of the pandemic on different regions and countries.

## SQL Queries

The SQL queries used in this project cover a range of analyses, including:

- Overview of COVID-19 data by continent
- Total cases, deaths, and population statistics
- Death percentage in specific countries
- Percentage of population infected
- Countries with the highest infection rates and death counts
- Continent-wise analysis
- Global statistics and death percentage
- Vaccination data and its impact on the population

Feel free to explore the queries to gain a deeper understanding of the project's data exploration.

## Views and Visualizations

This project also creates views to store data for later visualizations, including:

- Percentage of vaccinated population per country
- Vaccinated population for each country
- Deaths counts for continents
- Countries with the highest infection rate
- Percentage of infection in comparison with the population
- Countries with the highest death rates
